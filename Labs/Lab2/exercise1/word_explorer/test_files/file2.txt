The Impact of Hybrid Power Units

Since 2014, Formula One has used turbo-hybrid power units that blend technology and sustainability. These engines feature advanced energy recovery systems (ERS) that harness kinetic and heat energy, making F1 one of the most efficient racing series. However, the shift to hybrids was not without risk, as early reliability issues plagued teams. The quest for speed remains, with constant improvements in battery storage and energy deployment allowing for greater performance. Recent seasons have seen a push for synthetic fuels to make the sport even greener while maintaining high performance.
