Safety Innovations in Modern F1

Formula One has evolved significantly in terms of safety, yet risk remains an inherent part of the sport. The introduction of the halo device in 2018 has saved multiple lives, including Lewis Hamiltonâ€™s during the 2021 Italian GP. Advances in crash structures, fireproof suits, and medical response teams showcase how technology has reduced injuries and fatalities. However, the pursuit of speed brings new challenges, and ensuring driver safety while maintaining competitive racing is a key concern for the FIA.
