Tire Strategies and Their Role in Racing

Tire performance is a crucial factor in determining race outcomes, and recent F1 seasons have seen Pirelli introduce new compounds for better degradation management. The balance between speed and durability affects pit stop strategies, making tire choices a fundamental aspect of race strategy. However, pushing tires to their limit introduces risk, as seen in several high-speed blowouts. Advances in technology such as thermal imaging and real-time pressure monitoring help teams maximize tire efficiency while ensuring safety.
